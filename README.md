## Problem Statement

-. Increasing Cases of Mental Disorders:
Mental disorders such as stress, anxiety, depression, and other conditions are becoming more common, especially among the younger generation. Rapid changes in lifestyle, academic pressure, and social expectations can be triggering factors.
-. Lack of Access to Mental Health Services:
Many people find it difficult to access quality and affordable mental health services. The limited number of mental health professionals and high service costs often become major obstacles for many individuals to get the help they need.
-. Negative Stigma:
There is still a lot of negative stigma related to mental disorders in society, making people reluctant to acknowledge their problems or seek help. The fear of negative judgment or discrimination often prevents individuals from openly discussing their mental health and getting the necessary treatment.

## Solution

The Zenzone App is developed to address mental health issues by increasing awareness, providing support, facilitating access to resources, encouraging help-seeking behavior, and reducing stigma. It offers a safe online community, accurate information, and tools to manage mental health, thus bridging the gap between individuals and quality mental health care.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
